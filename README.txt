//GROUP EXPLORER
Have you ever wondered how to solve a Rubik's cube, or how we can know there are only 5 Platonic solids? How error-correcting 
codes are formed or where general relativity gets its foundations? Where the quadratic equation comes from, or why we can 
even solve polynomials? 

All of these answers lie in abstract algebra, or the study of algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields. 
Too often students embark on their study of abstract algebra by reading definitions and theorems. The definition of a group
is very simple; there are only three rules. It must be a set, including a binary operation with the following properties:

1. There is an operative identity, such that ea = ae for all a in A.
2. The operation is associative, or a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, for all a, b, c in a
3. All elements have an operative inverse, or an element b such that a + b = b + a = e. 

Without a solid background in algebra, this definition is dense and unhelpful. What does this mean? What does this have to do 
with computer science, or even really math?

The point of this program is to demonstrate the intuitive nature of abstract algebra and how it can be seen every day 
around us. The original intention was to create a fully interactive game, but I am not practiced enough with different game engines
to make anything functional. I did try for over eight hours on Godot, Gdev, and PyGame before I decided to do what I knew
the most about: a simple game that printed to the terminal.  

I hope that you see the intent behind this game and know that I really believe in its potential. I hope to learn enough about
game dev to be able to make this one day.
